# Data Lake Validator
## Short description
This project is intended to be used as a library for validation of spark dataframes.
Datafames are result of some applied spark operation on a particular dataset. 
Since dataframes are result of every operation/transformation applied to a dataset, validation and correction of data can be done after any operation. This library has operations, configured using yaml, which validate and/or correct the input data.# validation-framework
